# python-tuya-oittm
## Reason This Exists
I wanted a project to learn Python, and had just bought an Oittm Humidifer(https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C5QL15R) and wanted to integrate it with Home Assistant. This seemed like a good, non-trivial project to work on. All respect due to the forefathers - tuyapi and python-tuya (listed below).
